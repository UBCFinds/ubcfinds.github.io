# Project Requirements

## Overview

This document records the functional requirements for UBC Finds. Each requirement is identified with a numeric ID and a short description. References to sketches (Sketch 0 - 8) indicate the UI state or flow where the requirement applies. Acceptance criteria are provided where useful.

### 1.0 Initial Application State (Ref: Sketch 0)
- **R1.1:** The system must display an interactive map of the UBC campus upon initial load.

### 3.0 Sidebar Menu - Active State (Ref: Sketch 2)
- **R3.1:** Checking a utility category checkbox must cause all waypoints for that category to be displayed on the map.  
- **R3.2:** Unchecking a utility category checkbox must cause all waypoints for that category to be hidden from the map.  
- **R3.3:** All displayed waypoints must be color-coded to represent their working status.
